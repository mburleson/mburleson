# How my story begins...
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/mburleson/mburleson/blob/main/c64_new.png" width="200px"/>
I was raised on science fiction movies, books and video games. So, it wasnâ€™t a surprise to my parents when after getting my first computer when I was 5 â€“ a Commodore 64 â€“ I exclaimed that I was going to be a graphic designer when I grew up. I really liked Print Shop and Color Me.  After drawing my way through high school, I went on to college to earn my degree in Graphic Design.

## Then...

After college, while starting my career as a graphic designer designing stationary for major retail outlets, and print materials for the corporate world â€” I became fascinated by the web design and development. I fired up my left brain and taught myself a little bit of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Then, in 2006, I landed my first web development job. 
I began designing and developing professionally and never looked back.

## Now

I love HTML, CSS, JavaScript â€” the list keeps growing. One of the best parts of being in this profession is learning something new every time I tackle a big project. I love solving problems. I love the need to know how to get something to work, and not stopping until I get it rightâ€¦ even if it means I might stay up too late...
